# python_recursion
 
 
### Summary.
This folder ```python_recursion```,  is an exploration of recursion using Python 3.6.7.  There are seven exercises, one per Jupyter Notebook file.  The format of each file is as follows: an iterative function, a recursive function, and tests to ensure both functions perform correctly.

### Exercises.
There are seven exercises.  Below, are the files and a brief summary of each.
- ```01_SumOfList``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find the sum of a list.
- ```02_CounterOfList``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Find the number of members in a list.
- ```03_MaxOfList``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find the maximum value of a list.
- ```04_MinOfList``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find the minimum value of a list.
- ```05_FibonacciSequence``` Find the ith number of a Fibonacci Sequence.
- ```06_Factorial``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find the factorial of a number.
- ```07_DoublingNumbers``` &nbsp; &nbsp; Find the sum of doubled numbers in range of numbers.

### To Run:
- open a terminal/bash window.  Pull the files to the desktop: `git clone https://github.com/knishina/python_recursion.git`
- cd into the file you would like to explore.
- type `python <filename>.py to run.
- type `pytest` to run the unit tests of the <fliename>.py<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - if it does not run, type in `pip install -U pytest`
